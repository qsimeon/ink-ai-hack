# Ink Playground

React + TypeScript + Vite prototyping app for interactive ink-based elements
with handwriting recognition.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Setup
Copy the example env file and configure:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:
| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `INK_RECOGNITION_API_URL` | Handwriting recognition API endpoint | *(none — must be set)* |

You'll need a running instance of the recognition API. Set the URL in your `.env` file.

### Running
```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server, accessible on the local network
npm run build    # TypeScript compile + Vite production bundle
npm run lint     # ESLint check
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
```

The dev server is exposed on all network interfaces. The terminal output will show your network URL (e.g. `http://<your-ip>:5173`) that other devices on the same network can use to access the app.

### How It Works
Draw on the canvas with a pointer device. Strokes are captured, clustered,
and sent to the handwriting recognition API. Recognized content is converted
into interactive elements (text, shapes, TicTacToe grids, coordinate planes).

See `docs/New element HOWTO.md` for a guide on adding new element types.
